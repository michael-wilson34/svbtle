			How to get free, pre-released copies of your favorite author's new books
			</h5>

			<h6>

					Ever find a brand new book on Amazon, just released today, and wonder how it already has all those reviews? Or glance at a book cover, and think, "this was printed before the book was released to the public, but it's covered in testimonials from famous entrepeneurs, celebrities, and other writers."
				</p>

				<p>
					How do those reviewers get the book so early? How do I get in on this?
				</p>

				<p>
					Here’s how I do it.
				</p>

				<p>
					When we see a lot of other people looking at something, we become interested. It’s how our psychology works. So authors want their books surrounded with testimonials.
				</p>

				<p>
					Publishing companies and their public relations (PR) staff do work to get those reviews. They’ll spread early editions of the book to other authors under that same publishing company, or mail it out to influential people in their rolodex.
				</p>

				<p>
					But, I’m not a published author of a book, and I’m not famous, so I don’t have any PR person sending me free books from my favorite authors.
				</p>

				<p>
					How can I fix this?
				</p>

				<p>
					And it turned out, it was easy.
